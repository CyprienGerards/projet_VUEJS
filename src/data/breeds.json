      "en" :"Galloways are medium-sized, naturally polled beef cattle, with long, thick, curly coats in black, dun, or roan—adapted to cold, wet environments. Their double coat insulates and sheds rain, reducing shelter needs in rugged landscapes. Famous for tender, marbled beef, carcasses have excellent fat distribution suitable for high-end markets. Their hardiness and calm temperament make them perfect for conservation grazing and grass-fed operations. Low-input and environmentally efficient, they suit regenerative agriculture and low-cost pasture systems.",

Derived from Bos indicus breeds like the Kankrej and Ongole, they’re often gray or red with variation in shading. They tolerate high heat, high humidity, and resist parasites, making them ideal for tropical climates. Beef is lean and richly flavored, while Brahmans also impart hardiness and longevity to crossbred herds. Though maternal and slower-growing, they excel in sustainability-focused pasture systems across South America, the southern U.S., and Asia.",
